Creating a lambda function in aws
Serverless Service Backend using Lambda function

## ------Steps for creating lambda function-------  
1. Create an IAM Role for Your Lambda function:[view steps](https://aws.amazon.com/getting-started/projects/build-serverless-web-app-lambda-apigateway-s3-dynamodb-cognito/module-3/)
2. Create a Lambda Function for Handling Requests:
   AWS Lambda will run your code in response to events such as an HTTP request. In this step you'll build the core function that will process API requests from the web application to dispatch a unicorn. In the next module you'll use Amazon API Gateway to create a RESTful API that will expose an HTTP endpoint that can be invoked from your users' browsers. You'll then connect the Lambda function you create in this step to that API in order to create a fully functional backend for your web application.
